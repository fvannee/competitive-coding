This repository contains my personal collection of solutions to common competitive coding problems.
A large part of these problems are from the UvA website: https://uva.onlinejudge.org/ This website is one of the largest online databases with competitive programming problems.
Another part of this repository are solutions to problems of the Google Codejam: https://codejam.withgoogle.com/codejam/

A small note: some of the solutions in this repository are incomplete. I did not go through them one by one before archiving them here.
